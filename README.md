# python-capstone-finance-tracker
The Python capstone project for the Cognizant Python and Generative AI Externship

## Background
This capstone project is meant to show the skills and concepts I have learned so far about the fundamentals of Python. I had to incorporate concepts like variables, data types, control structures, loops, functions, string operations, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and exception handling, in making a personal finance tracker to log the user's expenses, categorize them, and allow them to view summaries. 
<br> Within this project I created a command-line Python program that allow users to: <br>
<li> Add an expense with a description, category, and amount. </li>
<li>View all expenses.</li>
<li>View a summary of expenses by category</li>
<li>Handle invalid inputs gracefully using exception handling.</li>
<li>Store data in a dictionary (category as key, list of tuples as values)</li>

## Concepts Used:
<li>While Loops</li>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>f-strings</li>
<li>Dictionaries</li>
<li>Tuples</li>
<li>Exceptions</li>
<li>Raising errors</li>
<li>Conditional statements</li>
